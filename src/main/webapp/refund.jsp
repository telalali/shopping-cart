            We understand that situations may arise where you may need to request a refund for your purchase.
            Please review our refund policy below:
        </p>

        <h3>Refund Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
            To be eligible for a refund, the item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it.
            It must also be in the original packaging.
        </p>

        <h3>Refund Process</h3>
        <p>
            If you meet the eligibility criteria, please contact our customer support team at support@shoppingcart.com
            within 30 days of receiving the product. Provide your order number and details about the item you would
            like to return. We will guide you through the return process.
        </p>

        <h3>Refund Timeframe</h3>
        <p>
            Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received
            your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
        </p>

        <p>
            If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original
            method of payment within a certain number of days.
        </p>
